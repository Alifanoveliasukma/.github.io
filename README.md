there are two pages that have some special functionalities:
  1. the <a href="https://411112.github.io">index</a> page which looks like a shell.
  	main files: "/index.html"; "/stylesheet.css"; "/js/commands.js" and "/js/shell.js"
	*** commands and their output are located at /js/commands.js
  2. the <a href="https://411112.github.io">contact</a> page that acts as a web based business card.
  	main files: "/contact/index.html"; "/contact/stylesheet.css"; "/js/qr-code" and some files at "/media" directory
	*** guesture/shortcuts to show qr-code is located at "js/qr-code.js".
